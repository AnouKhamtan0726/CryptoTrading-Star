                  <p>
                    1. You can become a Trusted User by locking your ALI tokens
                    on our platform. After successfully locking your ALI, you
                    will be immediately granted a “Trust Level” badge, which can
                    be found in your Profile.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    2. There are 5 types of "Trust Level" badges, corresponding
                    to 5 levels of Trusted User. The level is determined based
                    on the number of ALI tokens locked by users: Level 1 – 100
                    ALI locked; Level 2 – 500 ALI locked; Level 3 – 1000 ALI
                    locked; Level 4 – 2000 ALI locked; Level 5 – 5000 ALI
                    locked.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    3. The ALI tokens locked by Trusted Users will be staked on
                    AlitaSwap to earn daily rewards. The APY earned on locking
                    up your ALI under the “Trusted User” program (the “Program”)
                    equals that of staking your ALI via the “Stake ALI” feature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    4. The rewards gained under the Program will be
                    automatically compounded (reinvested) into the principal on
                    a daily basis.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    5. Uplines will receive commissions from their downlines’
                    earnings on locking ALI. The commission rates the uplines
                    are entitled to under the Program are similar to those
                    applied to the staking program.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    6. If you no longer wish to continue participating in the
                    Program, you may unlock your ALI tokens at any time by
                    clicking on the “Unlock” button.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    7. By voluntarily giving up on your "Trusted User" status,
                    you will no longer receive ALI rewards associated with
                    remaining in the Program. Your "Trust Level" badge in your
                    Profile will be revoked and your initial funds and interest
                    will be credited back to your Main wallet after a 7-day
                    waiting period.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    8. It is important to note that the 7-day waiting period
                    does not qualify as a locking period. Therefore, no rewards
                    for locking ALI will be given during this time frame.
                  </p>

                    policy or guideline of our platform, at any time and at our

                    via email.
